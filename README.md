College Football Playoff Probability Calculator
How to use

Set the input mode to moneyline or probability, then enter values for each matchup.

Pick your winners via dropdowns.

Click “Compute” to get Round 1, Quarterfinals, and overall path probability.

“Fill chalk” auto-selects the higher-probability path anchored on Indiana, Oregon, Ohio State, and Georgia.

If you want semifinals and final layers added, say the word and I’ll extend the calculator with dynamic bracket linking and cumulative paths.
