College Football Playoff Probability Calculator
This app helps you calculate the probability of advancing through a tournament bracket based on moneyline odds. It converts sportsbook odds into implied win probabilities, multiplies them across rounds, and shows the likelihood of your chosen path.

Features
- Moneyline input fields for each matchup  
- Fill chalk button to auto select higher probability winners  
- Compute path probability button to calculate the chance of all your picks hitting  
- Reset defaults to reload sample odds for testing  

How It Works
1. Enter the moneyline odds for each team in Round 1 and the Quarterfinals.  
2. Select your predicted winners for each matchup.  
3. Click Compute path probability to see:  
   - Round 1 combined P → product of your Round 1 picks’ implied probabilities  
   - Quarterfinals combined P → product of your Quarterfinal picks’ implied probabilities  
   - Overall path probability → chance all picks succeed (Round 1 × Quarterfinals)  
4. Use Fill chalk to auto select favorites if you want a quick baseline.  
5. Adjust odds or picks to explore different scenarios.  

Example
- Oregon  1600 vs James Madison +900 → Oregon implied win probability ≈ 94%  
- Alabama  115 vs Oklahoma  105 → nearly a coin flip (≈ 53% vs 47%)  
- If you pick Oregon and Alabama, their probabilities multiply into your Round 1 combined P.
